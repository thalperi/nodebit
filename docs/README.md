# Nodebit Documentation & Development Guide

**Warning: Nodebit is in early development. Most features are incomplete, experimental, or may not work as expected.**

This documentation is organized to help contributors, developers, and users find accurate, up-to-date information. We aim for honesty and clarity, not self-promotion. If something is missing or unclear, it probably means it hasn't been built yet.

> **For new users**: Start with the [main README](../README.md) for an overview, then return here for technical details and development information.

## üóÇÔ∏è Documentation Principles

- **Accuracy:** Reflects actual implementation, not aspirations
- **Modesty:** Avoids self-praise and overstatement
- **Clarity:** Links to canonical sources, avoids duplication
- **Maintenance:** Updated as features are built, not before
- **Reality:** If in doubt, assume a feature is incomplete
- **Cross-Reference:** Links to main README for user-facing information

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This is early-stage software. Many features are planned but not yet implemented. Only basic workspace functionality may exist. Use at your own risk and expect frequent changes.
