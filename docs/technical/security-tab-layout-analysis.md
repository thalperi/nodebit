# Security Tab Layout Analysis

**Warning: Nodebit is in early development. The security tab layout and features are incomplete and subject to change.**

For grid and layout implementation details, see [css-grid-security-guide.md](./css-grid-security-guide.md).

## Analysis and Issues

### Current Grid Structure
- The security tab uses a CSS Grid layout for DIDs and ACLs.
- Main grid: 1fr main content, 330px fixed sidebar; 2fr DID panel, 1fr ACL panel.

### Visual Layout Map
- Left: DID Management Area (creation, search, grid, expandable panels)
- Below: ACL Management Area (users/resources/permissions panels)
- Right: System Status Sidebar (system status, OrbitDB, admin identity, security info)

## Issues Identified

1. **Sidebar Too Wide**
   - Current: 330px fixed width
   - User request: reduce to ~198px
   - Issue: takes too much screen space
2. **Unwanted Visual Elements**
   - Possible vertical colored bar on left side
   - May be from tab styling or grid implementation
3. **Layout Inconsistency**
   - Security tab layout differs from Overview tab
   - Should be more consistent with Overview tab

## Recommendations

1. Reduce sidebar from 330px to 198px
2. Remove unwanted visual styling elements
3. Align layout approach with Overview tab
4. Ensure proper responsive behavior without unwanted expansion
