# Nodebit Functional Specification

**Warning: Nodebit is in early development. Most features are incomplete, and this document describes planned and demo functionality.**

## Implementation Matrix

| Component | Status | Core Features | Advanced Features |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **nb-workspace** | Early Development | Basic workspace creation, minimal dashboard, partial IPFS integration, partial DID/ACL security system, basic activity logging | Multi-network management, real-time statistics, network discovery, performance monitoring, activity log persistence, decentralized authentication, OrbitDB-based security storage |
| **nb-file** | Not Implemented | File operations (planned), IPFS integration (planned), upload/download (planned), CID management (planned) | Pin management, file discovery, metadata management, peer distribution tracking, DID-based access control |
| **nb-database** | Not Implemented | Database operations (planned), OrbitDB integration (planned), CRUD operations (planned), database types (planned) | Real OrbitDB, peer synchronization, conflict resolution, DID-based access control |

**Legend:**
- **Early Development**: Basic functionality exists, requires substantial development
- **Not Implemented**: Node exists in concept only, requires complete implementation
- **Planned**: Designed but not yet implemented

## Architecture Overview

Nodebit uses a configuration node pattern where nb-workspace acts as a shared configuration for operation nodes (nb-file, nb-database).

For node types, configuration, and message formats, see [node-roles.md](./node-roles.md).
For DID structure and API, see [did-management-guide.md](./did-management-guide.md).

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Complete DID/ACL security system, user authentication, permission management
- **Phase 2:** Implement nb-file node, real IPFS file operations, file management interface
- **Phase 3:** Implement nb-database node, OrbitDB integration, database management interface
- **Phase 4:** Advanced features (network management, performance optimization, advanced monitoring)

## Limitations

- Most features are incomplete or demo-only
- Real IPFS and OrbitDB integration is not yet available
- Message formats and configuration may change as features are implemented
