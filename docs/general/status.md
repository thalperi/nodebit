# Nodebit System Status

**Version**: 0.1.0-alpha  
**Completion**: Approximately 25-30%  
**Status**: Core dashboard functionality working, DID/ACL system partially operational

## What Actually Works

### nb-workspace (Working Implementation)
- ✅ Basic workspace creation and configuration
- ✅ Complete dashboard interface with all tabs functional
- ✅ DID/ACL security system (graceful fallback implementation)
- ✅ Activity logging system (comprehensive implementation)
- ✅ IPFS integration (network detection working)
- ✅ Expandable network management panels with copy functionality
- ✅ **Complete CSS Grid Layout**: Dashboard uses CSS Grid for all components
- ✅ Real-time system monitoring and status updates

### Dashboard Features (All Working)
- ✅ **Overview Tab**: Statistics grid, activity log with search/filter, copy functions
- ✅ **Networks Tab**: IPFS network detection, expandable management panels with fixed-width address lists and copy buttons (JSON/Text/XML)
- ✅ **Security Tab**: DID creation/management, ACL management, system status sidebar
- ✅ **Databases Tab**: Placeholder for future OrbitDB integration
- ✅ **Files Tab**: Placeholder for future IPFS file operations

### DID/ACL Security System (Partially Operational)
- ✅ DID creation with metadata and avatar support
- ✅ DID search and filtering functionality
- ✅ ACL management with user/resource/permission workflow
- ✅ Real-time permission grant/revoke operations
- ✅ System status monitoring and health checks
- ✅ Activity logging for all security operations
- ✅ Professional enterprise-grade interface design
- ⚠️ **Graceful Fallback**: Returns empty arrays when OrbitDB initialization fails

### Network Management (Working with Enhanced Features)
- ✅ Automatic IPFS network detection (Kubo, Helia)
- ✅ Network status monitoring and peer counting
- ✅ Expandable network details panels with management actions
- ✅ Fixed-width network address lists (max-width: 600px) with ellipsis truncation
- ✅ Copy buttons for JSON, Text (CSV), and XML formats
- ✅ Network-specific management actions
- ✅ Real-time connection status updates
- ✅ Maximum height panels with proper scrolling
- ✅ No horizontal scrollbars in expanding panels

### Activity Management (Working)
- ✅ Real-time activity loading and display
- ✅ Activity search and filtering functionality
- ✅ Copy all activities to clipboard (CSV format)
- ✅ Activity detail expansion/collapse
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 30 seconds for Overview tab
- ✅ Proper error handling for API calls

### nb-file (Not Implemented)
- ❌ File upload/download operations
- ❌ IPFS file management
- ❌ CID generation and tracking
- ❌ Pin management
- ❌ File discovery
- ❌ Metadata management
- ❌ DID-based access control

### nb-database (Not Implemented)
- ❌ Database operations
- ❌ OrbitDB integration
- ❌ CRUD operations
- ❌ Database types (documents, keyvalue, eventlog, counter)
- ❌ Peer synchronization
- ❌ Conflict resolution
- ❌ DID-based access control

## Current Issues

### Known Problems
1. **Security Tab Theming**: Inconsistent styling with other tabs
2. **DID/ACL System**: OrbitDB initialization failures causing graceful fallbacks
3. **Missing Node Types**: nb-file and nb-database not implemented

### Technical Debt
- OrbitDB dependency issues need resolution
- Security tab layout needs alignment with other tabs
- Some placeholder functionality in Databases and Files tabs

## Recent Improvements (Verified)

### Fixed Network Address List Width
- ✅ **Fixed Maximum Width**: Network addresses container limited to 600px maximum width
- ✅ **No Horizontal Scrollbars**: Container cannot expand beyond parent, preventing horizontal overflow
- ✅ **Ellipsis Truncation**: Long addresses show `...` when they exceed container width
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Container is 100% width up to 600px, then stops expanding
- ✅ **Proper Text Wrapping**: `word-wrap:break-word` provides additional overflow protection
- ✅ **Hover Support**: Full address visible on hover via `title` attribute

### Expandable Network Panels with Copy Functionality
- ✅ **Maximum Height Panels**: Network details panels now have 400px max height with scrolling
- ✅ **Scrollable Address Lists**: Network addresses section has 120px max height with scrollable container
- ✅ **Copy Buttons**: JSON, Text (CSV), and XML copy buttons for network addresses
- ✅ **Proper Scrolling**: Management actions remain accessible at bottom of panels
- ✅ **Activity Logging**: All copy operations logged to activity system

### Activity Management Enhancements
- ✅ **Copy All Activities**: CSV format export of displayed activities
- ✅ **Clipboard Integration**: Modern clipboard API with fallback for older browsers
- ✅ **Activity Logging**: All copy operations logged for debugging

## Architecture Status

### Working Components
- Dashboard interface with all tabs functional
- Expandable network panels with copy functionality
- Fixed-width address lists preventing horizontal overflow
- Activity logging system with comprehensive debugging
- Network detection and management
- Graceful error handling for DID/ACL system

### Technical Debt
- OrbitDB initialization failures causing graceful fallbacks
- Security tab layout inconsistency with other tabs
- Some placeholder functionality in Databases and Files tabs

---

**Status**: Dashboard functional with expandable networks, fixed-width address lists, and copy functionality. Security tab theming and DID/ACL system issues remain to be resolved.
