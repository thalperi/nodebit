# Development Status

## Current Status: UI Layout Issues - Partially Resolved

### ✅ Issues Fixed
- **Security Tab Theming**: Removed `background: #f8f9fa` and changed `padding: 12px` to `padding: 8px` for consistency
- **Network Table Layout**: Fixed table rows expanding to full height by using `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr`
- **CSS Grid Consistency**: All tabs now use consistent CSS Grid approach with proper overflow handling

### 🔧 Remaining Technical Issues
1. **Security Tab Complex Layout**: The 2x2 grid layout may still cause inconsistent behavior
2. **Layout Intuition**: Need to verify that the current layout meets user requirements for intuitive behavior
3. **Testing Required**: Need to test the current implementation to ensure it works as expected

### 📁 Files Affected
- `nodes/workspace/ui/html-generator.js` - CSS Grid template rows and panel structures
- `nodes/workspace/ui/dashboard-template.js` - Overview panel title removal
- `nodes/workspace/ui/security-template.js` - Security panel title removal

### 🎯 Next Session Goals
1. **Reconsider CSS Grid Approach**: Implement proper grid layout that works intuitively
2. **Fix Network Table Layout**: Ensure table rows display with normal height
3. **UI Consistency**: Make all tabs behave consistently
4. **User Experience**: Implement layout that meets user requirements

### 📊 Development Status
- **UI Layout**: ✅ Partially resolved - theming consistency and table layout fixed
- **CSS Grid**: ✅ Consistent implementation across all tabs
- **User Experience**: 🔄 Needs testing to verify intuitive behavior
- **Next Steps**: Test current implementation and address any remaining layout issues

### 📝 Session Notes
The UI layout issues have been partially resolved by:
1. Fixing security tab theming consistency (removed background color, standardized padding)
2. Fixing network table layout by using `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr` instead of `1fr`
3. Ensuring all tabs use consistent CSS Grid approach
4. Maintaining the CSS Grid architecture as specified in the project requirements

The current implementation follows the documented CSS Grid approach and should provide more intuitive behavior. Testing is needed to verify the layout meets user requirements. 

###  Workspace & Security Tab UI Freeze
- The Workspace and Security tabs are now sufficiently styled for their current feature sets.
- UI development for these tabs is frozen until further notice.
- Next session will focus on resolving connectivity issues for all IPFS instances (local and remote) and OrbitDB databases, including DID and ACL interaction.
