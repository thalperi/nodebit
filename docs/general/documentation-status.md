# Documentation Status and Recommendations

**Warning: Nodebit is in early development. Documentation is evolving and may be incomplete or out of date.**

## Documentation Quality Analysis

### üêë SHEEP (In Sync with Current Implementation)

#### Core Documentation (Accurate & Current)
- `README.md` - Accurate overview and navigation guide
- `architecture.md` - Describes modular architecture and real IPFS implementation
- `functional.md` - Implementation matrix showing nb-file as 'Working' with real IPFS
- `getting-started.md` - Current setup guide with accurate feature descriptions
- `node-roles.md` - Definitive and accurate node responsibilities documentation
- `troubleshooting-guide.md` - Current solutions for actual implementation issues

#### Security Documentation (Current & Accurate)
- `css-grid-security-guide.md` - Up-to-date CSS Grid implementation guide
- `security-grid-changelog.md` - Recent changes and improvements
- `security-tab-layout-analysis.md` - Layout analysis and recommendations
- `wip.md` - Current development status and context

#### Specialized Guides (Accurate)
- `examples/distributed-blog.md` - Realistic example using actual Nodebit capabilities
- `guides/orbitdb-ipfs.md` - Technical relationship explanation
- `ipfs-configuration.md` - Valid configuration options for real implementation
- `network-selection-strategy.md` - Strategy for multi-network scenarios

#### Node-RED Documentation (Accurate)
- `nodered/user-guide.md` - Node-RED patterns and examples
- `nodered/api-reference.md` - Node-RED API documentation
- `nodered/creating-nodes.md` - Node creation guide
- `nodered/developing-flows.md` - Flow development patterns
- `nodered/developing-the-core.md` - Core development guide

### üêê GOATS (Outdated, Incorrect, or Abandoned)

#### Task Management (Outdated)
- `todo.md` - Contains outdated security tasks that may already be implemented
- `missing-functions-task-list.md` - Restoration checklist that may be obsolete

#### Empty/Placeholder Files
- `did-management-guide.md` - Should contain DID management guide

## Summary

- **Total Files**: 21
- **Sheep (Accurate)**: 18 files (86%)
- **Goats (Problematic)**: 3 files (14%)

## Key Findings

### What's Working Well
1. Core documentation accurately reflects real IPFS implementation in nb-file
2. Security documentation is current
3. Architecture documentation describes modular design
4. Examples and guides are realistic and achievable

### What Needs Attention
1. `did-management-guide.md` - Needs content
2. `todo.md` - Needs review to remove completed tasks
3. `missing-functions-task-list.md` - Needs verification against current implementation

### Recommendations
1. Populate `did-management-guide.md` with DID management documentation
2. Review and update `todo.md` to reflect current development priorities
3. Verify `missing-functions-task-list.md` against actual implementation status
4. Maintain current documentation quality
