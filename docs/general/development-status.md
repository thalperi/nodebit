# Nodebit Development Status

## Current Reality: Early Development Stage

**Version**: 0.1.0-alpha  
**Completion**: Approximately 15-20%  
**Status**: Early development with substantial work remaining

## What Actually Works

### nb-workspace (Partial Implementation)
- ‚úÖ Basic workspace creation and configuration
- ‚úÖ Minimal dashboard interface
- ‚úÖ Basic Node-RED configuration node pattern
- üîÑ DID/ACL security system (incomplete)
- üîÑ Activity logging (basic implementation)
- üîÑ IPFS integration (minimal)

### nb-file (Not Implemented)
- ‚ùå File upload/download operations
- ‚ùå IPFS file management
- ‚ùå CID generation and tracking
- ‚ùå Pin management
- ‚ùå File discovery
- ‚ùå Metadata management
- ‚ùå DID-based access control

### nb-database (Not Implemented)
- ‚ùå Database operations
- ‚ùå OrbitDB integration
- ‚ùå CRUD operations
- ‚ùå Database types (documents, keyvalue, eventlog, counter)
- ‚ùå Peer synchronization
- ‚ùå Conflict resolution
- ‚ùå DID-based access control

## Major Work Remaining

### 1. Complete DID/ACL Security System (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Implement comprehensive user management
- Develop access control mechanisms
- Create authentication and authorization
- Build permission management interface
- Integrate security across all components

### 2. Implement nb-file Node (HIGH PRIORITY)
- File upload/download operations
- IPFS integration with Helia
- CID management and tracking
- Pin management for persistence
- File discovery and search
- Metadata management
- Integration with DID/ACL system

### 3. Implement nb-database Node (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Real OrbitDB integration
- Support for all database types
- CRUD operations
- Peer-to-peer synchronization
- Conflict resolution
- Integration with DID/ACL system

### 4. Enhanced Workspace Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Comprehensive network management
- Advanced IPFS configuration
- Performance monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Backup and restore functionality

### 5. Professional User Interface (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Complete dashboard implementation
- Advanced activity logging
- Real-time monitoring
- Professional styling and UX
- Mobile responsiveness

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Security (Current Focus)
- Complete DID/ACL implementation
- User authentication and authorization
- Permission management system
- Security integration testing

### Phase 2: File Operations
- Implement nb-file node
- IPFS file operations
- File management interface
- Integration with security system

### Phase 3: Database Operations
- Implement nb-database node
- OrbitDB integration
- Database management interface
- Peer synchronization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Network management
- Performance optimization
- Advanced monitoring
- Production readiness

## What This Means for Users

### Current Limitations
- **No file operations**: Cannot upload, download, or manage files
- **No database operations**: Cannot create or manage databases
- **Limited security**: DID/ACL system incomplete
- **Basic interface**: Dashboard lacks comprehensive features
- **No production use**: System not ready for real applications

### Development Focus
- Completing core functionality before adding features
- Building robust foundation before optimization
- Ensuring security integration throughout
- Maintaining Node-RED best practices

## For AI Assistants

### Language Guidelines
- **AVOID**: "Perfect", "Excellent", "Complete", "Finished", "Working", "Operational"
- **USE**: "Partial", "Basic", "Incomplete", "In Progress", "Requires Development"
- **ACKNOWLEDGE**: Substantial work remaining
- **FOCUS**: On what needs to be built, not what's "done"

### Development Approach
- Assume functionality is incomplete unless verified
- Focus on building missing components
- Prioritize core functionality over features
- Document actual capabilities, not aspirations

This is early-stage development. Much work remains to achieve the vision of a comprehensive decentralized storage solution for Node-RED.
