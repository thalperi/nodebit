## CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### **Avatar Management System** *(PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION)*
**Priority**: MEDIUM - User Experience Enhancement
**Status**: 🔄 PARTIAL - Basic avatar functionality exists, needs integration with complete DID system

**Current Features**:
- ✅ Instant preview on file selection
- ✅ Smart button text ("Choose Avatar" vs "Change Avatar") 
- ✅ Filename display and tracking
- ✅ Panel persistence during operations
- ✅ Proper event handling to prevent panel collapse

**Needs Integration**:
- 🔄 Complete integration with DID management system
- 🔄 Database persistence and retrieval
- 🔄 Error handling for upload failures
- 🔄 File type validation and size limits

### **Critical Priority: Complete nb-file and nb-database Implementation**
**Priority**: HIGH - Core Functionality Missing
**Status**: Not implemented - nb-file and nb-database nodes do not exist

**Current Database Limitations**:
- nb-database node uses in-memory simulation
- Mock OrbitDB addresses generated for testing
- No real peer-to-peer database synchronization
- Limited to simple key-value operations

**Planned Real OrbitDB Integration**:

1. **Real OrbitDB Implementation**:
   - Replace mock database with actual OrbitDB instances
   - Support for documents, keyvalue, eventlog, and counter database types
   - Real peer-to-peer synchronization between workspace instances
   - Persistent storage with proper conflict resolution

2. **Enhanced Database Operations**:
   - Complex queries and indexing
   - Database replication and backup
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Advanced access control integration

3. **Multi-Database Management**:
   - Support for multiple databases per workspace
   - Database discovery and connection management
   - Cross-database operations and transactions
   - Database migration and versioning tools

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Modify `lib/nodebit-core.js` to use Node ID for data directory isolation
- Create default admin DID during workspace initialization
- Implement first-time setup UI for admin account configuration
- Add password protection and validation for admin access
- Update Security UI to show admin dropdown with all admin DIDs
- Implement admin authentication and session management
- Add audit logging for admin actions and role changes

### **Activity Management System** *(NEEDS COMPLETION)*
**Priority**: HIGH - User Experience and Monitoring
**Status**: 🔄 PARTIAL - Basic activity logging exists, needs comprehensive features

**Required Features**:
- 🔄 Real-time activity search and filtering
- 🔄 Activity pagination for large datasets
- 🔄 Bulk CSV export functionality
- 🔄 Activity clear/cleanup operations
- 🔄 Activity detail expansion/collapse
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every 30 seconds for Overview tab
- 🔄 Proper error handling for API calls

### **DID Management System** *(NEEDS COMPLETION)*
**Priority**: HIGH - Core Security Functionality
**Status**: 🔄 PARTIAL - Basic CRUD operations exist, needs completion

**Required Features**:
- 🔄 Complete DID creation with full metadata
- 🔄 DID search and filtering functionality
- 🔄 DID form validation and error handling
- 🔄 DID deletion with confirmation dialogs
- 🔄 DID metadata editing (username, display name, email, role)
- 🔄 Contact & Organization section (organization, department, phone, location)
- 🔄 Notes & Description textarea
- 🔄 Save Changes, Reset, and Delete DID buttons

### **ACL Management System** *(NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION)*
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Access Control
**Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED - Basic structure exists, needs full implementation

**Required Features**:
- 🔄 User and resource selection panels
- 🔄 Permission management (grant/revoke)
- 🔄 Real-time permission updates
- 🔄 Permission validation and error handling
- 🔄 Integration with DID system for user management

### **Network Management System** *(NEEDS ENHANCEMENT)*
**Priority**: MEDIUM - System Monitoring
**Status**: 🔄 PARTIAL - Basic network display exists, needs enhancement

**Required Features**:
- 🔄 Network management panel with accordion behavior
- 🔄 Network-specific management UI generation
- 🔄 Helia and Kubo network detection
- 🔄 Network status monitoring and updates
- 🔄 Network configuration and management options

**Files to Modify**:
- `lib/nodebit-core.js` - Node ID-based data isolation and default admin DID creation
- `nodes/workspace/workspace.js` - Node ID extraction and workspace initialization
- `nodes/workspace/ui/` - New first-time setup UI templates
- `nodes/workspace/ui/security-template.js` - Admin dropdown UI
- `nodes/workspace/ui/client-scripts.js` - Admin authentication and setup functionality
- `nodes/workspace/api/security.js` - Admin authentication and password management APIs

**Security Benefits**:
- Complete workspace data isolation using Node ID-based directories
- Password-protected admin access with authentication
- Default admin DID with proper role-based permissions
- Eliminates cross-workspace data leakage
- Enables admin role management and delegation
- Provides per-workspace admin isolation and control
- Maintains audit trail of admin actions and authentication
- First-time setup ensures secure admin account configuration
