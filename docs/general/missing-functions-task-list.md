- **Result**: Clean deletion functionality without manual intervention required

### Current Status
The modularization process has achieved significant functionality with the complete restoration of the client-scripts implementation. The DID management interface is now fully operational with professional-grade editing capabilities, and the activity system provides real-time workspace monitoring.
