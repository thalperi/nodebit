- **Pin Management**: Control which files are kept permanently
- **Network Distribution**: See which networks store which files
- **Bulk Operations**: Pin/unpin multiple files at once

## Your First Node-RED Flow

Now let's create flows that interact with your workspace:

### File Upload Flow

1. **Create the Flow:**
   ```
   [inject] â†’ [nb-file] â†’ [debug]
   ```

2. **Configure the Inject Node:**
   - **Payload**: string
   - **Value**: "Hello, decentralized world!"
   - **Topic**: (leave empty)

3. **Configure the nb-file Node:**
   - **Name**: "Upload File"
   - **Workspace**: Select "My First Workspace"
   - **Operation**: "Auto-detect from message"

4. **Deploy and Test:**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Click the inject button
   - Check the debug panel for results

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "topic": "file.uploaded",
  "payload": {
    "cid": "QmDemo...",
    "file": {
      "name": "uploaded-file",
      "size": 28,
      "type": "text/plain"
    },
    "demo": true,
    "links": {
      "ipfs": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmDemo..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Database Operations Flow

1. **Create the Flow:**
   ```
   [inject] â†’ [nb-database] â†’ [debug]
   ```

2. **Configure the Inject Node:**
   - **Payload**: JSON
   - **Value**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Alice",
     "email": "alice@example.com",
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```

3. **Configure the nb-database Node:**
   - **Name**: "Store User Data"
   - **Workspace**: Select "My First Workspace"
   - **Operation**: "Auto-detect from message"
   - **Database Type**: "documents"

4. **Deploy and Test:**

   - Click the inject button
   - Check the debug panel for results

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "topic": "database.written",
  "payload": {
    "id": "1642680000000",
    "data": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com", 
      "role": "admin"
    },
    "demo": true
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Management

### Real-time Flow Monitoring

1. **Workspace Status:**
   - Deployed nodes show status indicators
   - Green dot: Ready and connected to workspace
   - Yellow ring: Workspace starting
   - Red ring: Error or no workspace configured

2. **Admin Interface Updates:**
   - The admin interface shows live data
   - Refresh tabs to see updated information
   - Statistics update automatically

### Flow Patterns

**File Processing Pipeline:**
```
[HTTP In] â†’ [nb-file: upload] â†’ [nb-database: index] â†’ [HTTP Response]
```

**Database Query API:**
```
[HTTP In] â†’ [nb-database: query] â†’ [Template] â†’ [HTTP Response]
```

**Monitoring Flow:**
```
[Timer] â†’ [nb-database: status] â†’ [Switch] â†’ [Email Alert]
```

## Understanding Demo Mode

### Current Limitations

Nodebit currently operates in **demo mode**, which means:

- **Mock Data**: All operations use simulated data
- **No Real IPFS**: Files aren't actually stored on IPFS
- **No Real OrbitDB**: Database operations use in-memory storage
- **Simulated Networks**: Network information is generated for demonstration

### Demo Benefits

- **Interface Testing**: Explore the basic admin interface
- **Flow Development**: Build and test Node-RED flows
- **Pattern Learning**: Understand how real operations will work
- **UI Familiarity**: Get comfortable with the management interface

### What Works in Demo Mode

- ðŸ”„ **Configuration Management**: Basic workspace setup, validation needs improvement
- ðŸ”„ **Admin Interface**: Basic interface, requires substantial development
- ðŸ”„ **Node-RED Integration**: Basic integration, needs enhancement
- ðŸ”„ **API Endpoints**: Limited endpoints, requires comprehensive implementation
- âœ… **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status indicators and feedback

## Preparing for Real Implementation

### Understanding the Transition

When real IPFS and OrbitDB integration is added:

1. **Same Interface**: The admin interface will look identical
2. **Same Flows**: Your Node-RED flows will work without changes
3. **Real Data**: Operations will use actual IPFS and OrbitDB
